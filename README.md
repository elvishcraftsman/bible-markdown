# Bible Markdown
Bible Markdown contains extended syntax elements for the Markdown specification.

Using Bible Markdown, you can simply use any plain text editor for Bible translating. You don't need to use formatting, but can use punctuation marks in a way that's readable and can easily be converted into formatting.

I was translating part of the Greek New Testament to practice my Greek. Formatting was a challenge. I started with LibreOffice. Then I edited in USFX, which could be translated into good formatting, but that was difficult to write in. I didn't want to install a Bible editing program. So I developed Bible Markdown instead.
